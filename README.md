# In-Context-Learning

This project came out of my work in CS 224U at Stanford University. The results, architecture, and more elements of the project are highlighted in the repository's report. However, due to Stanford policy, the code cannot be shared publicly. Despite this, the report can be shared to highlight the intricacies of the project.
